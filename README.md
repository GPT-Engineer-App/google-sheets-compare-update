# google-sheets-compare-update

I need to create Google app scrip, that compares two Gooogle Sheets. One have data for production and another one have fresh data that updates daily. 

Google Sheets have following structure:
InsertedOn	Product	Family Name	LicenseType	Platform	PlatformDisplay	FamilyKey	TotalSoFar

1. I need to compare two Google Sheets in following way:
if rows matches on:  Product	and LicenseType, then compare TotalSoFar, if it is different then update Google Sheet for production with new values for TotalSoFar and also update InsertedOn.

2. After we update all data, we should order by TotalSoFar desc
